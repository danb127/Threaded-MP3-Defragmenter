# Threaded-MP3-Defragmenter
A multithreaded C program that traverses a directory tree, finds fragmented MP3 files, and reconstructs them by concatenating the fragments in the correct order. This project demonstrates the use of file I/O, threading, and synchronization techniques to efficiently defragment MP3 files.
