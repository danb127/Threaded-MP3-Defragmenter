# 🎵 MP3 Defragmenter using Threads 🧩

Welcome to the MP3 Defragmenter project! This project is an exciting exploration of file I/O, multithreading, and synchronization techniques in C. The goal is to create a program that traverses a directory tree, finds fragmented pieces of an MP3 file, and concatenates them in the correct order to form a complete MP3 file.

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes
By completing this project, you will gain hands-on experience with:
- Writing a Makefile to compile a C program
- Using file stream functions for binary file I/O
- Utilizing the thread library to create and join threads
- Implementing a mutex to share data structures between threads
- Applying memory allocator functions effectively

## 🗂️ Repository Structure
- `defrag.c`: The main source code file containing the implementation of the MP3 defragmenter
- `Makefile`: The Makefile used to compile the program
- `dirs/`: A sample directory tree containing fragmented MP3 pieces for testing
